# DiscordThemeInjector
Tampermonkey scripts to inject the betterdiscord themes onto browser discord. 
Note: you can make your own but remember to modify the css files by copy pasting the import urls to one file. Then, upload it to a discord and copy the link that way its hosted by discord and ready to be used. 
My personal favorite theme is SoftX
